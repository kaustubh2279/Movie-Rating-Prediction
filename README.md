Movie Rating Prediction Using Machine Learning
Welcome to the Movie Rating Prediction project repository! In this project, I aimed to predict IMDb ratings for movies using regression techniques. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, how to use it, and more.

**Introduction**
Machine learning is transforming various industries, and the film industry is no exception. In this project, I used regression to predict movie ratings based on multiple factors such as genre, budget, cast, and more. The goal is to provide insights that could help filmmakers and studios better understand audience preferences and optimize their productions for improved ratings.

**Dataset**
To train and evaluate our regression models, we used the "Movie Ratings" dataset. This dataset includes a collection of records with information about various aspects of movies and their corresponding ratings. 

**Conclusion**
By analyzing the model's performance through metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), we found that, on average, there is an error of approximately 0.75 in predictions. This indicates that the predicted IMDb ratings deviate by about 0.75 points from the actual ratings on average.
