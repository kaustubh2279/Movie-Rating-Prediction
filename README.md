# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Rating Prediction

Welcome to the **Movie Rating Prediction** project repository! In this initiative, I set out to forecast IMDb ratings for movies using advanced regression techniques. This README provides a comprehensive overview of the project, its goals, usage instructions, and additional insights.

## ðŸŒŸ Introduction

Machine learning is revolutionizing numerous sectors, and the film industry is no exception. In this project, I leveraged regression analysis to predict movie ratings based on various factors, including genre, budget, cast, and more. The primary objective is to furnish filmmakers and studios with valuable insights that can enhance their understanding of audience preferences and refine their productions for improved ratings.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

To train and evaluate the regression models, we utilized the **"Movie Ratings"** dataset. This dataset encompasses a rich collection of records detailing multiple aspects of films, along with their corresponding IMDb ratings. 

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

Upon analyzing the model's performance through key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), we discovered that the predictions exhibit an average error of approximately **0.75**. This signifies that the estimated IMDb ratings typically deviate by about **0.75 points** from the actual ratings, highlighting the model's effectiveness in capturing audience sentiments.
